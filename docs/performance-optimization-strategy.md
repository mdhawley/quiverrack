# Performance Optimization Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the performance optimization strategy for QuiverRack during the product validation stage, balancing security needs with user experience.

## Current Performance Issues

### Security Features Impact (Added January 2025)

1. **Middleware Processing Overhead**
   - Session validation: ~20-50ms per request (database queries)
   - Scraping detection: ~50-200ms (pattern analysis, history tracking)
   - Artificial delays: 1-5 seconds for "suspicious" behavior
   - Audit logging: ~10-30ms (database writes)
   - Input sanitization: ~5-15ms (DOMPurify on every string)

2. **Identified Bottlenecks**
   - Every API request hits database for session validation
   - Complex pattern analysis runs on every request
   - Synchronous audit logging blocks responses
   - Heavy sanitization on all inputs

## Optimizations Already Implemented

### 1. Development Mode Bypass
- Middleware skips all heavy processing in development
- Added `X-Middleware-Bypass: development` header

### 2. Authenticated User Fast Path
- Users with valid JWT tokens skip:
  - Pattern detection and behavior analysis
  - Artificial throttling delays
  - Heavy security checks

### 3. Session Validation Caching
- In-memory cache with 5-minute TTL
- Reduces database hits significantly

### 4. Async Audit Logging
- Fire-and-forget pattern for non-critical logs
- Increased batch size to 500

### 5. Performance Monitoring
- Added `X-Middleware-Duration` header to track processing time

## Future Optimization Strategy

### Security Levels

```typescript
const SECURITY_LEVELS = {
  VALIDATION: 'validation',    // Minimal security for invited users
  BETA: 'beta',               // Moderate security for beta
  PRODUCTION: 'production'     // Full security for public launch
}
```

### Balanced Approach: "Catastrophic Protection with Good UX"

#### Rate Limiting Strategy
```typescript
const RATE_LIMITS = {
  anonymous: { window: '1m', max: 100 },
  authenticated: { window: '1m', max: 500 },
  auth_endpoints: { window: '1m', max: 10 }
}

const ENDPOINT_LIMITS = {
  // Expensive operations
  '/api/v1/profiles': { window: '1m', max: 30 },
  '/api/v1/auth/signup': { window: '1h', max: 10 },
  '/api/v1/upload': { window: '1h', max: 50 },
  
  // Liberal for read operations  
  '/api/v1/skis': { window: '1m', max: 200 },
  '/api/v1/resorts': { window: '1m', max: 200 },
}
```

#### Sample-Based Scraping Detection
```typescript
// Only analyze 10% of requests for patterns
if (Math.random() < 0.1) {
  behaviorAnalysis = await scrapingDetector.analyzeBehavior(identifier, requestInfo)
}
```

#### Conditional Middleware
```typescript
// Skip middleware for cached content
if (request.headers.get('x-cache') === 'HIT') {
  return NextResponse.next()
}

// Skip for health checks
if (pathname === '/api/health') {
  return NextResponse.next()
}
```

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Immediate Optimizations (Validation Stage)
1. **Smart Rate Limiting**
   - Higher limits for authenticated users
   - Endpoint-specific limits
   - Remove delays for authenticated users

2. **Reduce Processing Overhead**
   - Sample-based pattern detection (10% of requests)
   - Skip session DB checks for valid JWTs
   - Async all non-critical operations

3. **Add Caching Layer**
   - Redis for rate limiting and sessions
   - CDN for static content
   - Cache GET endpoints (1-5 min TTL)

### Phase 2: Beta Preparation
1. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - APM integration (DataDog/New Relic)
   - Custom performance dashboards
   - Alert on response times > 500ms

2. **Database Optimization**
   - Add indexes on frequently queried fields
   - Connection pooling optimization
   - Query plan analysis

3. **Load Testing**
   - Simulate Reddit "hug of death"
   - Test with 1000+ concurrent users
   - Identify breaking points

### Phase 3: Production Readiness
1. **Full Security Suite**
   - Re-enable all pattern detection
   - Implement CAPTCHA challenges
   - Add IP reputation checking

2. **Advanced Caching**
   - GraphQL query caching
   - Personalized cache strategies
   - Edge computing for global performance

## Performance Targets

### Validation Stage (Current)
- Normal users: 50-100ms response time
- Authenticated users: 20-50ms response time
- 99th percentile: < 200ms

### Beta Stage
- Normal users: 100-150ms response time
- Authenticated users: 50-100ms response time
- 99th percentile: < 300ms

### Production Stage
- Normal users: 150-200ms response time
- Authenticated users: 100-150ms response time
- 99th percentile: < 500ms

## Security Trade-offs

### What We Keep (Catastrophic Protection)
- Basic rate limiting (prevents total meltdown)
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- XSS protection (light sanitization)
- Authentication for user actions
- DDoS protection at CDN level

### What We Optimize
- Pattern detection (sampling instead of every request)
- Session validation (caching + JWT trust)
- Audit logging (async/batched)
- Input sanitization (selective)

### Risk Acceptance
- Some scrapers may slip through (acceptable for validation)
- Less detailed audit trail (can increase later)
- Potential for burst traffic (rate limits as backstop)

## Quick Reference: Environment Variables

```bash
# Security level control

# Performance flags
ENABLE_PATTERN_DETECTION=false  # Disable for max performance
PATTERN_DETECTION_SAMPLE_RATE=0.1  # Sample 10% of requests
ENABLE_AUDIT_LOGGING=true
AUDIT_LOG_BATCH_SIZE=500

# Rate limiting
RATE_LIMIT_ANONYMOUS=100  # per minute
RATE_LIMIT_AUTHENTICATED=500  # per minute
RATE_LIMIT_AUTH_ENDPOINTS=10  # per minute

# Caching
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
CACHE_TTL_SESSIONS=300  # 5 minutes
CACHE_TTL_API=60  # 1 minute
```

## Monitoring Checklist

- [ ] Average response time < 100ms
- [ ] 99th percentile < 200ms
- [ ] Error rate < 0.1%
- [ ] Database connection pool utilization < 80%
- [ ] Memory usage stable
- [ ] No artificial delays for authenticated users
- [ ] Rate limit hits < 1% of traffic

## Next Steps

1. Implement Redis for caching and rate limiting
2. Set up CDN with appropriate cache headers
3. Add performance monitoring dashboard
4. Run load tests to validate targets
5. Create runbook for scaling during viral events
