# Pre-Launch Checklist for QuiverRack

Based on a comprehensive analysis of the codebase, here's what needs to be done before launch:

## üö® Critical Issues (Must Fix)

### 1. Email Verification Decision
- Email verification is currently **disabled** despite being a stated requirement
- Choose one approach:
  - **Option A**: Enable email verification (1-2 days work)
  - **Option B**: Document this as a known trade-off and plan for future implementation
- See `/docs/email-verification-analysis.md` for detailed analysis

### 2. Build Errors
- Fix React unescaped entities in 3 admin files:
  - `/apps/admin/src/app/page.tsx` (line 181)
  - `/apps/admin/src/app/skis/unverified/page.tsx` (line 399)
  - `/apps/admin/src/app/users/page.tsx` (line 327)
- Fix ESLint configuration issue in UI package
- Add missing React Hook dependencies in 4 files

### 3. Failing Tests
- 71 out of 95 tests are failing
- Resort picker tests failing due to missing mock data
- Ski entry modal tests failing due to incorrect fetch mock setup
- Tests must pass before deployment

### 4. Rate Limiting
- Documentation claims it's implemented but it's not
- Add rate limiting middleware to prevent API abuse
- Critical for preventing denial of service attacks

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Issues (Should Fix)

### 1. Admin Authentication System
- No role-based access control for admin panel
- Any authenticated user can potentially access admin endpoints
- TODOs indicate need for proper admin auth tracking:
  - Line 43 in `/apps/admin/src/app/api/admin/reports/[id]/route.ts`
  - Need to track which admin resolves reports

### 2. Code Quality
- 20+ instances of TypeScript `any` types reducing type safety
- 33 console.log statements that should be removed for production
- Missing database transactions for atomic operations
- TODO at line 32 in `/apps/web/src/app/api/v1/profiles/route.ts`

### 3. CORS Configuration
- No CORS headers configured
- Needed if API will be accessed from different domains
- Important for mobile app or third-party integrations

### 4. Incomplete Features
- Admin reports listing endpoint returns 501 (Not Implemented)
- TODO at line 177 in `/apps/web/src/app/api/v1/reports/route.ts`
- No audit trail for admin actions

## üìã Nice to Have (Can Launch Without)

### 1. Performance Optimizations
- Public profile API caching issue causing stale data
- Consider implementing proper caching strategy
- Known issue documented in CLAUDE.md

### 2. Enhanced Security
- Add API key authentication for external access
- Implement security monitoring and logging
- Add failed authentication attempt tracking
- Consider implementing Content Security Policy

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Update CLAUDE.md to reflect actual implementation decisions
- Document all environment variables needed for deployment
- Create deployment guide
- Update API documentation

## üöÄ Deployment Readiness Checklist

### Environment Setup
- ‚úÖ Environment variables properly configured
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded secrets found
- ‚úÖ Security headers configured in next.config.js
- ‚úÖ SQL injection protection via Supabase ORM
- ‚úÖ Example .env files provided

### Database
- ‚úÖ Migrations appear complete (latest: 013_fix_user_skis_schema.sql)
- ‚úÖ RLS policies mentioned (verify they're active in production)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to verify production data seeding for:
  - Ski brands and models
  - Resorts data
  - Terrain types

### Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Vercel deployment configuration present
- ‚úÖ Supabase integration configured
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to verify:
  - Email delivery configuration (SMTP settings)
  - Storage bucket policies
  - Production environment variables

### Security Findings
- ‚úÖ Input validation present in API routes
- ‚úÖ Password strength requirements implemented
- ‚úÖ Admin panel blocks production access
- ‚úÖ Email allowlist for admin access
- ‚ùå No rate limiting implementation
- ‚ùå No CORS configuration
- ‚ùå No proper admin role system

## üìä Estimated Timeline

### Minimum Viable Launch (Critical fixes only): 2-3 days
- **Day 1**: Fix build errors, tests, and make email verification decision
- **Day 2**: Implement rate limiting and basic admin auth
- **Day 3**: Testing and deployment preparation

### Recommended Launch (Critical + Important): 4-5 days
- Additional 1-2 days for:
  - Code quality improvements
  - CORS setup
  - Basic admin role implementation
  - Production data verification

## üéØ Launch Decision Points

1. **Email Verification**: Must decide whether to launch without it
   - If launching without: Document the security trade-off
   - If implementing: Add 1-2 days to timeline

2. **Admin Security**: Determine if basic email allowlist is sufficient
   - Current: Any user in allowlist can access all admin functions
   - Recommended: At least add audit logging for admin actions

3. **Rate Limiting**: Essential for preventing API abuse
   - Can use simple in-memory solution for MVP
   - Consider Redis-based solution for production scale

4. **Test Coverage**: All tests should pass before production
   - Currently 24/95 tests passing (25% pass rate)
   - Focus on critical path tests first

## üîß Quick Fixes (< 1 hour each)

1. React unescaped entities (use &quot; and &apos;)
2. ESLint configuration path fix
3. Remove console.log statements
4. Add missing useEffect dependencies

## üìù Final Pre-Launch Verification

Before deploying to production, verify:

- [ ] All tests pass (`pnpm test`)
- [ ] Build succeeds (`pnpm build`)
- [ ] No TypeScript errors (`pnpm typecheck`)
- [ ] No lint errors (`pnpm lint`)
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] Database migrations tested on staging
- [ ] Email delivery tested (if enabled)
- [ ] Admin panel access restricted
- [ ] Rate limiting active
- [ ] Error monitoring configured (e.g., Sentry)
- [ ] Analytics configured (mentioned in CLAUDE.md)
- [ ] Terms of Service and Privacy Policy URLs valid
- [ ] SSL certificates configured
- [ ] Domain DNS configured correctly

## üö¶ Go/No-Go Criteria

**Must have for launch:**
- Build succeeds without errors
- Core user flows work (profile creation, ski/resort management)
- Basic security measures in place
- Data persistence verified

**Can defer post-launch:**
- Email customization
- Advanced admin features
- Performance optimizations
- Enhanced analytics
