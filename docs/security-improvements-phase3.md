# Security Improvements - Phase 3

## Overview
This document outlines the additional security improvements implemented after the initial two phases of security hardening.

## 1. Admin Environment Variable Security
**Issue**: Admin emails and user IDs were exposed to the client through `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefixed environment variables.

**Solution**:
- Removed `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix from admin configuration variables
- Created server-side only `/api/v1/auth/admin-status` endpoint
- Admin configuration now completely hidden from client-side code

**Files Modified**:
- `/apps/web/.env.example`
- `/apps/web/src/config/admin.ts`
- `/apps/web/src/app/api/v1/auth/admin-status/route.ts` (created)

## 2. SSRF Protection in Cron Endpoints
**Issue**: The ski link processing cron endpoint made internal HTTP requests using user-controllable URLs.

**Solution**:
- Created internal `processSkiLinksInternal()` function that processes ski links directly
- Removed HTTP requests from cron endpoint
- Direct database operations prevent SSRF attacks

**Files Modified**:
- `/apps/web/src/lib/ski-link-processor.ts` (created)
- `/apps/web/src/app/api/v1/process-ski-links/cron/route.ts`

## 3. Secure Session Management
**Issue**: Profile authentication state was stored in localStorage, which can be manipulated by users.

**Solution**:
- Created `/api/v1/auth/profile-status` endpoint for server-side profile verification
- Created `useProfileStatus()` hook for React components
- Removed all localStorage authentication checks
- Profile state now verified server-side on each request

**Files Modified**:
- `/apps/web/src/app/api/v1/auth/profile-status/route.ts` (created)
- `/apps/web/src/hooks/useProfileStatus.ts` (created)
- `/apps/web/src/app/onboarding/page.tsx`
- All dashboard pages (removed localStorage usage)

## 4. API Pagination
**Issue**: Resort browse endpoint returned all resorts without pagination, risking DoS.

**Solution**:
- Added pagination parameters (page, limit)
- Maximum 500 resorts per request
- Added country/state filtering options
- Returns pagination metadata

**Files Modified**:
- `/apps/web/src/app/api/v1/resorts/browse/route.ts`

## 5. Enhanced Security Headers
**Issue**: Some security headers were missing.

**Solution Added**:
- `Permissions-Policy`: Restricts browser features (camera, microphone, etc.)
- `Referrer-Policy`: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- `X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies`: none

**Files Modified**:
- `/apps/web/next.config.js`

## 6. Standardized Error Responses
**Issue**: Error messages exposed internal implementation details.

**Solution**:
- Created `ApiErrors` utility for consistent error responses
- Hides sensitive details in production
- Logs full errors server-side for monitoring
- Provides error codes for client handling

**Files Created**:
- `/apps/web/src/lib/api-errors.ts`

**Files Updated**:
- Multiple API endpoints now use standardized errors

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Server-side session validation only
- ✅ No client-side authentication state
- ✅ Admin configuration hidden from client
- ✅ All sensitive operations require server verification

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- ✅ Zod schemas for all user inputs
- ✅ SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
- ✅ XSS prevention in user-generated content

### API Security
- ✅ Rate limiting (multi-tier with liberal limits)
- ✅ CORS properly configured
- ✅ Security headers comprehensive
- ✅ Error messages sanitized
- ✅ Pagination on data-heavy endpoints

### Infrastructure Security
- ✅ SSRF protection
- ✅ Path traversal prevention
- ✅ No secrets in client code
- ✅ Secure file uploads

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Remove `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix from admin variables
   - Ensure `CRON_SECRET` is set
   - Verify all API keys are server-side only

2. **Database Migrations**:
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```
   - Run migrations 064 and 065 for rate limiting tables

3. **Testing**:
   - Test anonymous user flows
   - Verify admin access works
   - Check rate limiting behavior
   - Test error responses

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Set up alerts for rate limit violations
   - Monitor for authentication failures
   - Track API error rates

## Future Security Considerations

1. **Implement CAPTCHA** for suspicious behavior
2. **Add request signing** for mobile app API
3. **Implement API versioning** with deprecation
4. **Add security event webhook** notifications
5. **Consider WAF** (Web Application Firewall) for additional protection

## Summary

These improvements significantly enhance the security posture of QuiverRack:
- Authentication state is now completely server-managed
- Admin access is properly hidden
- APIs are protected against common attacks
- Error handling prevents information leakage
- Rate limiting protects against abuse while being liberal for legitimate users

The application is now ready for production deployment with a robust security foundation.
