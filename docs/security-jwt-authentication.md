# JWT Authentication Security Improvements

## Overview

This document describes the enhanced JWT authentication security measures implemented to address the insecure token handling vulnerability identified in the security audit.

## Security Issues Addressed

1. **No JWT verification** - Tokens were passed directly to `supabaseAdmin.auth.getUser()` without cryptographic verification
2. **No token expiration checks** - Expired tokens could potentially be accepted
3. **No refresh token rotation** - Missing automatic token refresh mechanism
4. **Using admin client for user verification** - The service role key bypassed RLS

## Implementation Details

### 1. JWT Verification Utility (`packages/supabase/src/auth/jwt-verify.ts`)

- Uses the `jose` library for cryptographic JWT verification
- Validates token structure, signature, and claims
- Checks token expiration (`exp` claim)
- Verifies issuer (`iss`) and audience (`aud`) claims
- Implements token caching to reduce verification overhead
- Enforces maximum token age (7 days)

### 2. Enhanced Authentication Middleware (`apps/web/src/lib/api-middleware.ts`)

- Performs JWT verification before database lookup
- Implements proper error handling for different token failure scenarios
- Tracks authentication failures for security monitoring
- Returns appropriate HTTP status codes (401 for expired, 429 for blocked)
- Adds security headers to all authenticated responses

### 3. Token Refresh Endpoint (`apps/web/src/app/api/v1/auth/refresh/route.ts`)

- Handles refresh token rotation securely
- Issues new access tokens with proper expiration
- Logs refresh events for security monitoring
- Clears old tokens from cache

### 4. Client-Side Token Interceptor (`apps/web/src/lib/auth-interceptor.ts`)

- Intercepts all API calls to add authentication
- Automatically refreshes expired tokens
- Queues requests during token refresh to prevent race conditions
- Handles authentication failures gracefully

### 5. Security Monitoring (`apps/web/src/lib/security-monitor.ts`)

- Tracks authentication failures by IP address
- Detects suspicious patterns (e.g., valid JWT but missing user)
- Implements temporary blocking after multiple failures
- Provides metrics for security monitoring

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Add the following to your `.env.local` or `.env.production`:

```
SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-from-supabase-dashboard
```

### Getting Your JWT Secret

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ API
3. Find the JWT Secret under "Config"
4. Copy the secret and add it to your environment variables

## Security Benefits

1. **Cryptographic Verification** - All tokens are cryptographically verified before use
2. **Protection Against Token Tampering** - Invalid signatures are immediately rejected
3. **Automatic Token Refresh** - Users stay logged in without security compromise
4. **Attack Detection** - Multiple failed attempts trigger blocking mechanisms
5. **Audit Trail** - All authentication events are logged for security analysis
6. **Performance** - Token caching reduces verification overhead

## Testing

Run the JWT verification tests:

```bash
cd packages/supabase
pnpm test
```

## Migration Notes

- The changes are backward compatible
- Existing sessions will continue to work
- Users may need to re-authenticate if their tokens are very old (>7 days)

## Future Enhancements

1. **IP-based rate limiting** - Implement Redis-based distributed rate limiting
2. **CAPTCHA integration** - Add CAPTCHA after multiple failed attempts
3. **Email alerts** - Notify admins of suspicious activity
4. **Session management UI** - Allow users to view and revoke active sessions
5. **Biometric authentication** - Add WebAuthn support for enhanced security
